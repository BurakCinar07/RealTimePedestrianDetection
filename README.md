# RealTimePedestrianDetection

Real time pedestrian detection using deep neural networks with motion detection.

We used Daimler Pedestrian Dataset to train our network. We obtained 83% accuracy. After training network we need to detect moving objects that need to be tested with trained network. We used background substraction method to detect moving objects.

We developed this projected with github.com/orcantiryaki.
